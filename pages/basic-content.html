       <h1>BASIC CONTENT</h1>
       <h2>05.02.01 Campaign site</h2>
           <p>For the assignment for Foodsharing Copenhagen we made a campaign called ‘Beauty is on the inside’. We came up with the idea when we were brainstorming and talking about food waste. We found out that Danes though out lots of perfectly good food just because it looks ugly. Since Foodsharing CPH gives away free food that does not meet the supermarkets’ criteria we thought this would be the perfect campaign idea. It is a good idea because it’s a common phrase – and a cliché, but we wanted to change that, and get the phrase to be thought provoking.</p>
           <p>We followed Foodsharing CPH’s style tile and made our campaign site a copy of theirs – as good as possible. We wanted our campaign to be a page on their website.</p>

        <div class="ext-links">
            <p>See our campaign site for Foodsharing CPH <a href="http://astridcaecilie.dk/foodsharingcph/" target="_blank">here.</a> Note that some effects only work with safari or firefox</p>
        </div>
        <h2>05.02.03 Storyboard</h2>
        <p>To execute our campaign idea, we wanted to make multiple short movies that would also fit on social media. The plot in the movies are that you see two pieces of fruit next to each other, one shiny, good looking and one with spots and grim. A knife gets into the image and cuts the two pieces of fruit in two. When they fall apart you can see that they are the same on the inside.</p>
        <div class="ext-links">

        </div>
        <h2>05.02.04 Customer Pitch</h2>
        <p>When we tested our pitch in class before presenting it to Foodsharing CPH we found out that we were missing something. We had to be clearer on how we were going to use social media and also to be sharper with the comparison of our website and Foodsharing CPH’s. We had to be more vivid in cold facts about food waste and add some imagery to support our speech.</p>

        <div class="ext-links">
            <p>We added all the new changes to our presentation you can see <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NslE_UyiPEZPVJU6uoAM-Veiga1w09iBBxrr87aw_CE/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank"> here.</a></p>
            <p>The presentation went really well, and we got nice feedback from both the teachers and Foodsharing Copenhagen.</p>
