    <h1>BASIC WEB</h1>
    <h2>02.04.01 Responsive website</h2>
    <p>In Basic web we learned different design principles such as The Gestalt Laws, contrasts and composition. I used these principles at my responsive website to make a visually clear navigation bar that stood out from the rest of the page with the colors and the similarity between the options in it. I used high contrast colors and made sure to use the principle of proximity when I placed items that belonged together. </p>

    <p>We learned what a moodboard was and that you use it to gather information and inspiration and also how to make a style tile and that it is used to collect all design choices in one page, so it is clearer how the design looks.</p>
    <img src="../images/Moodboard-psychedelic-art-final.jpg" alt="moodboard" height="250">
    <p> We tried making our own logos and icons by sketching in hand at first and then remake it in illustrator. This gave me a basic knowledge of handling illustrator, but also how much an icon can say without words. On my website I initially decided to put a home icon in the navigation bar, but when I had to code it, I found out that I had to drop the idea, since it was not possible to place it where I wanted. I made a logo that is visible in the top left corner at all time. </p>

    <img class="logo-color" src="../images/logo-colors.png" alt="logo colors" height="200">

    <p>Coding wise we learned about semantic markup and basic HTML and CSS. We learned about multi-device layout patterns, and when I coded my responsive website, I wrote semantic correct markup that validated. We learned about breakpoints, media queries and grids. I used all of these terms in order to make the website design change as the screen size were altered. </p>

    <p>The Trunk test was introduced, and I used it to test my website. I found out that people had some troubles with the colors – there wasn’t enough contrasts. I also need explanations next to images and there were some missing headliners. The test persons liked that the navigation bar was very clear with what page the user is on by changing from grey to pink.
    After the test I changed some colors to darker or lighter hues and added all the missing text.</p>
